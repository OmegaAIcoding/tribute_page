    <h2>Pioneer & Explorer</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Born November 2, 1734 in Pennsylvania. (a separate, erroneous date is often cited due to a different calendar used by some people of the time period)</li>
    <li>During Boone's youth, he would herd the family cattle and provide food by hunting small game.  He was well-known for his fondness of the outdoors.</li>
    <li>Around 1955, in his early adulthood, Boone fought in the French and Indian War alongside the British.  The British offensive suffered large casualties and Daniel left to go back home but desired to go to Kentucky one day after hearing about it from a fellow militia-man.</li>
    <li>After several years of roaming, Daniel Boone ventured to Kentucky to begin exploring the territory in 1767.  His expeditions traveled back and forth between settlements and home, and his adventuring party was attacked by Native Americans on several occasions.  Eventually he and his men built Boonesborough, a settlement town which was also frequently attacked.</li>
    <li>In 1778, Boone was himself captured by the Shawnee tribe.  He was held in captivity but eventually considered an adopted tribesman due to his skills on the frontier.  However, he still escaped to Boonesborough after four months.</li>
    <li>After many years on the settlement, Boone was unable to keep Boonesborough due to debt and title issues.  In 1799, he moved his family to Missouri.  He was granted an authority position by the Spanish and was give about 850 acres of land.</li>
    <li>He became famous in his position of authority for judging disputes amongst settlers underneath a large tree which the townspeople called "Judgement Tree."</li>
    <li>Boone and his family lived off the land in Missouri until his natural death at his son's home.</li>
    <li>Daniel Boone, who would become a legend to future generations, died September 26, 1820.</li>
